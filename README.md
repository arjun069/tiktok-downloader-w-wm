# tiktok video downloader :)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/arjun069)

TikTok Downloader is a (to be cloud-enabled) video downloader for tiktok.
Unfortunately it won't work in India unless you use a vpn but I'll add proxy support soon so that y'all don't need to worry about that.

### Installation

Tiktok Downloader does not requires any programming language to run.
(well it would be nice if you had python but not necessary)

    click on main.exe and enter the video url to be downloaded

using python:

```sh
$ cd to folder where you downloaded it
$ python main.py
```

### Todos

 - add front end (mostly in rust using Valerie)
 - deploy to cloud make it a full fledged alt tiktok server so everyone can use it even w country bans (hope i dont go to jail for this tho)
